/**
 * \ingroup rpc
 *
 * This defines a distributed vector of scalar values for machine
 * learning.  The data is stored on a machine determined by part of
 * the hash value.  The method is intended to be used with fibers.
 *
 * The table is designed for machine learning purposes by providing a
 * number of methods specialized to ML type operations.  Furthermore,
 * any new values are implicitly initilized to zero; calling get() on
 * a value not previously set returns zero.
 *
 * The keys are given as type WeakToken, which essentially just stores
 * a 128 bit hash value.  Conversion from integer and other data types
 * is done implicitly.  Many optimizations are possible.
 *
 * Currently, this version simply wraps the scalar_dht; however, this
 * will diverge in the future as many optimizations are possible to
 * take advantage of the ordering of the keys.  The methods available,
 * however, will remain the same.
 *
 * \tparam T The data type.
